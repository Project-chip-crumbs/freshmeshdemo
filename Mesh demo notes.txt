Mesh demo example:
Two devices: each has 4 buttons
When not in mesh, each is DO-RE-MI-FA
When both in mesh, 1 is DO-RE-MI-FA, other is SO-LA-TI-DO
Etc.
Each renders its own button presses: music is spatialized.
Could have one subscribe as "renderer" which only listens to button presses and plays entire tune.

How to do GPIO?
How to address a GPIO on mesh or local, how to discover GPIOs (should be announced?)
Maybe like OSC, listeners would output:
/member/gpio/0/ <pin state>

Try to prototype the reordering problem. If 5 enter, they show 1,2,3,4,5. A couple leave, they get 1,2, others are renumbered 1,2,3
need to figure out how to "store" the array based on count of peers.

Find package that can render text-to-image. Display is a small graphic display that shows frame buffer.
